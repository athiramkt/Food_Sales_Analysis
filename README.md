## SCENARIO

A food sales company wants to analyze its sales data from 2020 and 2021 to gain insights into the performance of various products, categories, and cities, including items like cookies, bars, crackers, and snacks. Using this information, the company aims to identify key trends and develop high-level recommendations to optimize product offerings and enhance sales and marketing strategies.

## ASK

Business Tasks
Key business questions to guide the analysis:
> 1. Which product categories and specific products are driving the most sales?
> 2. How do sales vary across different cities?
> 3. What are the sales trends over time in 2020 and 2021?
> 4. Are there any seasonal patterns in sales?.

## PREPARE

This phase focuses on setting up the environment and exploring the dataset to ensure a thorough analysis.

**Evaluating Data Validity**:

The food sales dataset undergoes a quality assessment to provide a clear snapshot of sales performance across various products, cities, and categories, offering both high-level summaries and detailed views of sales during the 2020-2021 timeframe.
> 1. Reliability: The analysis is based on a simulated dataset containing 244 sales records from 2020-2021, representing multiple cities and product categories.
> 2. Originality: Although the data is artificially generated for educational purposes, it facilitates an in-depth examination of sales trends across products, categories, and geographic regions.
> 3. Comprehensiveness: Robust statistical techniques in R are used to explore sales patterns, uncovering insights into product performance, seasonal trends, and market segmentation.
> 4. Currency: The dataset focuses on sales data from 2020-2021.
> 5. Limitations: As the dataset is simulated and covers a limited timeframe, its primary purpose is to serve as a learning tool rather than a definitive source for business decision-making.

## Analyze

After completing cleaning and formatting, we can now explore the data from a broader perspective. By generating high-level summary statistics, we aim to conduct a descriptive analysis to identify sales data patterns and trends by category, product, and date.

**View Sales By Category (Here we do some analysis to check which categories had the most sales)**
```r
my_sales_clean_data %>%
  select(city, category, product,order_date, quantity, unit_price, total_price) %>%
  group_by(category) %>%
summarise( total_sales_by_category = sum(total_price)) %>%
arrange(desc(total_sales_by_category))
```
```r
# A tibble: 4 Ã— 2
  category total_sales_by_category
  <chr>                      <dbl>
1 Cookies                   17212.
2 Bars                      10536.
3 Crackers                   3340.
4 Snacks                     2238.
```
**Finding**: 
The analysis of total sales by category reveals that cookies are the highest-performing product category, contributing significantly to overall sales with 17,212 units sold. Bars follow with 10,536 units, while crackers and snacks show relatively lower sales figures of 3,340 and 2,238 units, respectively. This indicates a strong customer preference for cookies and bars compared to other product categories.

**View Sales By Product (Here we do some analysis to check which Products had the most sales)**
```r
 my_sales_clean_data %>%
  select(city, category, product,order_date, quantity, unit_price, total_price) %>%
  group_by(product) %>%
summarise( total_sales_by_product = sum(total_price)) %>%
arrange(desc(total_sales_by_product))
```
```r
# A tibble: 9 Ã— 2
  product        total_sales_by_product
  <chr>                           <dbl>
1 Carrot                          7411.
2 Oatmeal Raisin                  7310.
3 Arrowroot                       5330.
4 Chocolate Chip                  4572.
5 Whole Wheat                     3340.
6 Bran                            2945.
7 Potato Chips                    1652.
8 Pretzels                         586.
9 Banana                           179.
```
**Finding**:
The analysis of total sales by product shows that Carrot and Oatmeal Raisin are the top-performing products, with 7,411 and 7,310 units sold, respectively. Arrowroot and Chocolate Chip follow with 5,330 and 4,572 units. In contrast, Banana and Pretzels have the lowest sales, with just 179 and 586 units sold, respectively. This indicates a strong preference for baked goods like Carrot and Oatmeal Raisin over snack items like Pretzels and Banana.

**View Sales By Order date (Here, we perform an analysis to identify which products had the highest sales during a specific period. The lubridate library is utilized to extract the year and month from the dataset.)**

```r
my_sales_clean_data %>%
  mutate(month_name = month(order_date, label = TRUE)) %>%
  mutate(saleyear = year(order_date)) %>%
  group_by(saleyear, month_name) %>%
  summarise(total_sales_by_product = sum(total_price), .groups = "drop") %>%
  arrange(desc(saleyear), desc(month_name))
```
```r

**Finding**:
**Analysis of Monthly Sales by Year (2021)**:

> 1. Peak Sales Month:
        December 2021 recorded the highest sales with 1,515 units, indicating strong performance, likely influenced by holiday shopping trends.

> 2. Consistent High Sales Periods:
        Sales remained relatively high during April (1,537 units), March (1,405 units), and November (1,979 units), showing consistent demand during these months.

> 3. Lower Sales Periods:
        The lowest sales occurred in September (826 units) and July (849 units), potentially due to seasonal variations or lower consumer demand during those months.

> 4. Seasonal Trends:
        Sales appear to fluctuate across the year, with peaks in holiday seasons and dips during mid-year. This suggests seasonality plays a significant role in sales performance.

> 5. Strategic Insight:
        Marketing efforts and promotions could be focused on periods with historically lower sales (e.g., July and September) to boost performance.
        December's high sales highlight the importance of capitalizing on the holiday season with targeted campaigns and sufficient stock.

## Share

We'll begin by analyzing the data through visualizations to uncover key insights and present our findings in a clear and impactful manner to the marketing team and other stakeholders.

**Sales by product**
```r
ggplot(data = my_sales_clean_data, aes(x = product, y = total_price, fill = product)) +
  geom_col() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 30, color = "dark blue")) +
  labs(
    title = "Product-Wise Sales Analysis",
    caption = "Visualization based on sample data for testing purposes",
    x = "Product Name",
    y = "Total Sales ($)"
  ) +
  guides(fill = guide_legend(title = "Product Categories"))
```
![Sales by Product](Images/Sales_by_product.png)

Looking at the product-level sales data, here are the key insights:

> 1. Carrot and Oatmeal Raisin products are the top performers, each with approximately 7,000 sales units, suggesting a strong consumer preference for these flavors.
> 2. Arrowroot is the third-best seller with around 5,000 units, performing notably well for a less common flavor.
> 3. Chocolate Chip shows solid performance with roughly 4,500 units, aligning with typical consumer preferences for chocolate products.
There's a significant drop in sales volume between the top performers and lower-selling products like Potato Chips and Pretzels, which barely reach 2,000 units.
> 4. Banana has the lowest sales volume of all products, suggesting it might be worth reconsidering its place in the product lineup.

**Recommendations**
A key recommendation would be to investigate what makes Carrot and Oatmeal Raisin products so successful - whether it's marketing, pricing, placement, or product quality - and apply those learnings to boost performance of lower-selling items. Additionally, given Banana's poor performance, resources might be better allocated to expanding successful product lines or developing new flavors based on the top performers' characteristics.

Based on the sales data visualization across four major cities, here are the key insights:

1. Cookies are consistently the best-selling category across all cities, with Boston showing the highest cookie sales at approximately 6,000 units.

2. Bars are the second most popular category, with relatively consistent sales across cities (ranging from about 1,500 to 3,500 units).

3. Boston appears to be the strongest market overall, showing higher sales volumes across most categories, particularly in cookies and crackers.

4. Los Angeles and San Diego show similar sales patterns but at different scales, with Los Angeles having higher overall volumes.

5. Crackers and Snacks are the lowest-performing categories in all cities, with particularly low sales in Los Angeles and San Diego.

**Recommendations**
A potential opportunity would be to investigate why the West Coast cities (Los Angeles and San Diego) have significantly lower cracker sales compared to Boston, and whether there are regional preferences that could inform product strategy.

Looking at the sales breakdown by city and product category, here are the key insights:

1. Product Mix Analysis:
- Cookies are dominated by Chocolate Chip and Oatmeal Raisin across all cities
- Bars category shows a consistent mix of Carrot, Bran, and Arrowroot
- Crackers and Snacks categories have much lower sales overall and simpler product mix

2. Regional Patterns:
- Boston shows the strongest performance overall, especially in Cookies
- New York and Los Angeles have similar patterns but at lower volumes than Boston
- San Diego consistently shows the lowest sales across all categories

3. Notable Opportunities:
- The success of Chocolate Chip and Oatmeal Raisin cookies in Boston could be studied and replicated in other cities
- The significant drop between East Coast (Boston/NY) and West Coast (LA/San Diego) performance suggests potential for market development
- Banana products show consistently low performance across all categories and cities, suggesting a need for product review

**Recommendations**:
Focus on understanding why Boston's market performs so well and apply those learnings to boost performance in West Coast markets, particularly San Diego.
