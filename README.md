## SCENARIO

A food sales company wants to analyze its sales data from 2020 and 2021 to gain insights into the performance of various products, categories, and cities, including items like cookies, bars, crackers, and snacks. Using this information, the company aims to identify key trends and develop high-level recommendations to optimize product offerings and enhance sales and marketing strategies.

## ASK

Business Tasks
Key business questions to guide the analysis:
> 1. Which product categories and specific products are driving the most sales?
> 2. How do sales vary across different cities?
> 3. What are the sales trends over time in 2020 and 2021?
> 4. Are there any seasonal patterns in sales?.

## PREPARE

This phase focuses on setting up the environment and exploring the dataset to ensure a thorough analysis.

###Evaluating Data Validity:
The food sales dataset undergoes a quality assessment to provide a clear snapshot of sales performance across various products, cities, and categories, offering both high-level summaries and detailed views of sales during the 2020-2021 timeframe.
> 1. Reliability: The analysis is based on a simulated dataset containing 244 sales records from 2020-2021, representing multiple cities and product categories.
> 2. Originality: Although the data is artificially generated for educational purposes, it facilitates an in-depth examination of sales trends across products, categories, and geographic regions.
> 3. Comprehensiveness: Robust statistical techniques in R are used to explore sales patterns, uncovering insights into product performance, seasonal trends, and market segmentation.
> 4. Currency: The dataset focuses on sales data from 2020-2021.
> 5. Limitations: As the dataset is simulated and covers a limited timeframe, its primary purpose is to serve as a learning tool rather than a definitive source for business decision-making.


#Install and load packages to setup the environment
The data is imported from an excel document into a dataframe called foodsales.

## PROCESS
We need to verify the column names first to ensure consistency, as all column names must match exactly.

**Clean Data**: To ensure data quality and consistency, we'll clean and tidy the datasets. This involves handling missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies in data formats.

**Clean the column names and check if all data types are correct**

```r
my_sales_clean_data <- clean_names(foodsales) # Clean the column names
```
```r
colnames(my_sales_clean_data)  # View the cleaned column names 
```
```r

[5] "product"     "quantity"    "unit_price"  "total_price"
```
```r
sum(is.na(my_sales_clean_data)) # Total NA values

## Analyze

After completing cleaning and formatting, we can now explore the data from a broader perspective. By generating high-level summary statistics, we aim to conduct a descriptive analysis to identify sales data patterns and trends by category, product, and date.

**View Sales By Category (Here we do some analysis to check which categories had the most sales)**
```r
my_sales_clean_data %>%
  select(city, category, product,order_date, quantity, unit_price, total_price) %>%
  group_by(category) %>%
summarise( total_sales_by_category = sum(total_price)) %>%
arrange(desc(total_sales_by_category))
```
```r
# A tibble: 4 Ã— 2
  category total_sales_by_category
  <chr>                      <dbl>
1 Cookies                   17212.
2 Bars                      10536.
3 Crackers                   3340.
4 Snacks                     2238.
```
**Finding**: 
The analysis of total sales by category reveals that cookies are the highest-performing product category, contributing significantly to overall sales with 17,212 units sold. Bars follow with 10,536 units, while crackers and snacks show relatively lower sales figures of 3,340 and 2,238 units, respectively. This indicates a strong customer preference for cookies and bars compared to other product categories.

**View Sales By Product (Here we do some analysis to check which Products had the most sales)**
```r
 my_sales_clean_data %>%
  select(city, category, product,order_date, quantity, unit_price, total_price) %>%
  group_by(product) %>%
summarise( total_sales_by_product = sum(total_price)) %>%
arrange(desc(total_sales_by_product))
```
```r
# A tibble: 9 Ã— 2
  product        total_sales_by_product
  <chr>                           <dbl>
1 Carrot                          7411.
2 Oatmeal Raisin                  7310.
3 Arrowroot                       5330.
4 Chocolate Chip                  4572.
5 Whole Wheat                     3340.
6 Bran                            2945.
7 Potato Chips                    1652.
8 Pretzels                         586.
9 Banana                           179.
```
**Finding**:
The analysis of total sales by product shows that Carrot and Oatmeal Raisin are the top-performing products, with 7,411 and 7,310 units sold, respectively. Arrowroot and Chocolate Chip follow with 5,330 and 4,572 units. In contrast, Banana and Pretzels have the lowest sales, with just 179 and 586 units sold, respectively. This indicates a strong preference for baked goods like Carrot and Oatmeal Raisin over snack items like Pretzels and Banana
