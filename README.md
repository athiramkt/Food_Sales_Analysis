## SCENARIO

A food sales company wants to analyze its sales data from 2020 and 2021 to gain insights into the performance of various products, categories, and cities, including items like cookies, bars, crackers, and snacks. Using this information, the company aims to identify key trends and develop high-level recommendations to optimize product offerings and enhance sales and marketing strategies.

## ASK

Business Tasks
Key business questions to guide the analysis:
> 1. Which product categories and specific products are driving the most sales?
> 2. How do sales vary across different cities?
> 3. What are the sales trends over time in 2020 and 2021?
> 4. Are there any seasonal patterns in sales?.

## PREPARE

This phase focuses on setting up the environment and exploring the dataset to ensure a thorough analysis.

**Evaluating Data Validity**:
The food sales dataset undergoes a quality assessment to provide a clear snapshot of sales performance across various products, cities, and categories, offering both high-level summaries and detailed views of sales during the 2020-2021 timeframe.
> 1. Reliability: The analysis is based on a simulated dataset containing 244 sales records from 2020-2021, representing multiple cities and product categories.
> 2. Originality: Although the data is artificially generated for educational purposes, it facilitates an in-depth examination of sales trends across products, categories, and geographic regions.
> 3. Comprehensiveness: Robust statistical techniques in R are used to explore sales patterns, uncovering insights into product performance, seasonal trends, and market segmentation.
> 4. Currency: The dataset focuses on sales data from 2020-2021.
> 5. Limitations: As the dataset is simulated and covers a limited timeframe, its primary purpose is to serve as a learning tool rather than a definitive source for business decision-making.

## Analyze

After completing cleaning and formatting, we can now explore the data from a broader perspective. By generating high-level summary statistics, we aim to conduct a descriptive analysis to identify sales data patterns and trends by category, product, and date.

**View Sales By Category (Here we do some analysis to check which categories had the most sales)**
```r
my_sales_clean_data %>%
  select(city, category, product,order_date, quantity, unit_price, total_price) %>%
  group_by(category) %>%
summarise( total_sales_by_category = sum(total_price)) %>%
arrange(desc(total_sales_by_category))
```
```r
# A tibble: 4 Ã— 2
  category total_sales_by_category
  <chr>                      <dbl>
1 Cookies                   17212.
2 Bars                      10536.
3 Crackers                   3340.
4 Snacks                     2238.
```
**Finding**: 
The analysis of total sales by category reveals that cookies are the highest-performing product category, contributing significantly to overall sales with 17,212 units sold. Bars follow with 10,536 units, while crackers and snacks show relatively lower sales figures of 3,340 and 2,238 units, respectively. This indicates a strong customer preference for cookies and bars compared to other product categories.

**View Sales By Product (Here we do some analysis to check which Products had the most sales)**
```r
 my_sales_clean_data %>%
  select(city, category, product,order_date, quantity, unit_price, total_price) %>%
  group_by(product) %>%
summarise( total_sales_by_product = sum(total_price)) %>%
arrange(desc(total_sales_by_product))
```
```r
# A tibble: 9 Ã— 2
  product        total_sales_by_product
  <chr>                           <dbl>
1 Carrot                          7411.
2 Oatmeal Raisin                  7310.
3 Arrowroot                       5330.
4 Chocolate Chip                  4572.
5 Whole Wheat                     3340.
6 Bran                            2945.
7 Potato Chips                    1652.
8 Pretzels                         586.
9 Banana                           179.
```
**Finding**:
The analysis of total sales by product shows that Carrot and Oatmeal Raisin are the top-performing products, with 7,411 and 7,310 units sold, respectively. Arrowroot and Chocolate Chip follow with 5,330 and 4,572 units. In contrast, Banana and Pretzels have the lowest sales, with just 179 and 586 units sold, respectively. This indicates a strong preference for baked goods like Carrot and Oatmeal Raisin over snack items like Pretzels and Banana.

**View Sales By Order date (Here, we perform an analysis to identify which products had the highest sales during a specific period. The lubridate library is utilized to extract the year and month from the dataset.)**

```r
my_sales_clean_data %>%
  mutate(month_name = month(order_date, label = TRUE)) %>%
  mutate(saleyear = year(order_date)) %>%
  group_by(saleyear, month_name) %>%
  summarise(total_sales_by_product = sum(total_price), .groups = "drop") %>%
  arrange(desc(saleyear), desc(month_name))
```
```r

**Finding**:
**Analysis of Monthly Sales by Year (2021)**:

> 1. Peak Sales Month:
        December 2021 recorded the highest sales with 1,515 units, indicating strong performance, likely influenced by holiday shopping trends.

> 2. Consistent High Sales Periods:
        Sales remained relatively high during April (1,537 units), March (1,405 units), and November (1,979 units), showing consistent demand during these months.

> 3. Lower Sales Periods:
        The lowest sales occurred in September (826 units) and July (849 units), potentially due to seasonal variations or lower consumer demand during those months.

> 4. Seasonal Trends:
        Sales appear to fluctuate across the year, with peaks in holiday seasons and dips during mid-year. This suggests seasonality plays a significant role in sales performance.

> 5. Strategic Insight:
        Marketing efforts and promotions could be focused on periods with historically lower sales (e.g., July and September) to boost performance.
        December's high sales highlight the importance of capitalizing on the holiday season with targeted campaigns and sufficient stock.

## Share

We'll begin by analyzing the data through visualizations to uncover key insights and present our findings in a clear and impactful manner to the marketing team and other stakeholders.

**Sales by product**
```r
ggplot(data = my_sales_clean_data, aes(x=product, y=total_price, fill=product)) +
geom_col()+
theme(axis.text.x = element_text( angle = 30, color = "dark blue")) +
labs(title ="Sales by Product",
       caption = "Sample sales data downloaded for test purposes",
       x="Product",
       y="Total Sales")
       knitr::include_graphics("Images/Sales_by_product.png")
```
The chart provides a clear representation of total sales for each product, allowing for an in-depth analysis of sales performance. Below are key takeaways from the data:

1. **Top-Performing Products**

Chocolate Chip and Oatmeal Raisin lead in total sales, significantly outperforming other products.
> 1. This indicates high customer preference or successful marketing strategies for these items.
> 2. These products could be considered the "star performers" of the sales portfolio, and further efforts could focus on sustaining or expanding their market reach.

2. **Low-Performing Products**

Products like Banana, Bran, and Pretzels exhibit the lowest sales.
> 1. This may indicate limited customer interest, insufficient promotion, or lower availability.
> 2. These items might require a closer evaluation, such as assessing their pricing, distribution, or appeal to target customers.
> 3. Alternatively, it could indicate a potential need to phase out underperforming products if efforts to improve sales don't yield results.

3. **Moderate Performers**

Products such as Arrowroot, Carrot, and Whole Wheat show moderate sales levels.These products might benefit from targeted marketing campaigns to boost sales and move closer to the top-performing category.

4. **Product Diversification and Market Trends**

The variety of products suggests a diverse product line aimed at catering to various consumer preferences. However, the significant disparity in sales between the top and bottom products suggests the need for a better understanding of market trends or consumer behavior.

5. **Recommendations**

> 1. **Enhance Marketing**: Focus on promoting low-performing products (e.g., Banana and Bran) through strategic marketing campaigns, discounts, or bundling with top-performing items.
> 2. **Product Assessment**: Analyze whether the underperforming products align with customer preferences and market demand.
> 3. **Leverage High Performers**: Build promotional campaigns around the popularity of Chocolate Chip and Oatmeal Raisin to attract even more customers.
> 4. **Review Pricing and Availability**: Ensure all products are priced competitively and widely available to customers.
